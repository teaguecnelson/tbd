Genesis Sample TBD Theme (The Budget Diet)

This theme was adapted from the Genesis Sample Theme on July 1, 2018.

Styling:
It uses NPM package node-sass (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for Sass compiling.
to run, get into 'genesis-sample-tbd' directory and use 'npm run scss' to start compiling watch script.

NOTE (TO BE FIXED):
The style.scss file must be saved every time a change is made in any of the scss files in order for the css compiler to run.
Also Make sure that in Chrome Dev tools, caching is turned off in 'Network' Tab. 

It's using most of the Genesis Sample Theme CSS File, and adding Scss compiled alterations and additions to the end of _genesis_sample.scss
