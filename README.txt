Genesis Sample TBD Theme

This theme was adapted from the Genesis Sample Theme (July 1, 2018).

Styling:
It uses NPM package node-sass (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for Sass compiling.
to run, get into 'genesis-sample-tbd' directory and use 'npm run scss' to start compiling watch script.

NOTE (TO BE FIXED):
The style.scss file must be saved every time a change is made in any of the scss files in order for the css compiler to run.
Also Make sure that in Chrome Dev tools, caching is turned off in 'Network' Tab.
